# Employee Database Investigation

Say that I recently got my dream job as a data engineer at a respectable company (how lucky am I to work at Pewlett Hackard!). I've recently been given six CSV files containing various pieces of information about company employees from the 1980s and 1990s. I need to design tables to hold these CSVs and import them into a SQL database, and then analyze them.

I also have a sneaking suspicion that the data I've been given are fake. After completing the requested analyses, I import my database into Pandas with sqlalchemy to generate visualizations to investigate further.
